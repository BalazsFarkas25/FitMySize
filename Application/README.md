## Application Section

I implemented a simple Front-End and Server part, to create a user-friendly option to showcase the Cloth size suggestion process.

Currently, I have a front-end where you can take a picture, which gets sent to the Python server for evaluation. 

## Note
Currently, this Python server returns a sample value "M" in every case. Returning a valid suggestion is still #TODO


## Front-End
run ```nvm use && yarn && yarn dev```

## Back-End
run ```pip install -r requirements.txt && python api.py```
